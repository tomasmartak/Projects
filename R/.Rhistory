### 1. Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(tibble) #not necessary, but then you won't have that lovely tibble. Look it in the eyes and tell it you don't want it. C'mon. Thought so.
library(xml2) #table scraper from online html
library(rvest) #table scraper from online html
### 2. Functions
#create recurrence function; I was too lazy to learn to use Roxygen2 (might do later if I feel cute)
#What does the function do? Easy. You paste in the Title entry corresponding of the row that includes the 1st recurrent cancer data.
recurrence <- function(divider){
i = 1
while(df$Title[i] != divider){
df$Title[i] <- "non-recurrent"
i = i + 1
}
for(a in i:nrow(df)){
if(df$Title[a] != "non-recurrent"){
df$Title[a] <- "recurrent"
}
}
df$Title <<- df$Title #global assignment operator; very useful if you want the data created to actually leave this "nice" function.
} #see info above; this function is nice.
### 3. Define the URL of the GEO graphs webpage you want to analyse
webpage_url <- "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS2206:IMAGp998J225591" #enter webpage here
first_recurrence <- "	P72 dilated cardiomyopathy heart biopsy"#enter 1st recurrence threshold value for df$Title
### 4. Run this code to get a graph.
webpage <- xml2::read_html(webpage_url) #reads url
df <- rvest::html_table(webpage)[[2]][,1:3] %>% tibble::as_tibble() %>% tidyr::drop_na() # the index here is [[2]]; [,1:3] removes useless af rank
graph_title <- toString(rvest::html_table(webpage)[[1]][2,2]) # saves the graph title
dataset_name <- gsub("/","-",rvest::html_table(webpage)[[1]][1,2]) # saves name of dataset for ease of saving the file
recurrence(first_recurrence)
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Title, y = Value))+
geom_bracket(data = df, xmin = "non-recurrent", xmax = "recurrent", label = "", size = 0.75, y.position = 1.05*max(df$Value))+
geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Title)) +
geom_jitter(shape=16, width = 0.1) +
expand_limits(y = 1.07*max(df$Value)) + #just in case the lable is outside the scope
stat_compare_means(aes(label = paste0(..method.., ", ", "p =", ..p.format..)),
method = "t.test", label.x = 1.35, label.y = 1.07*max(df$Value)) + #put ..p.format.. as label for p value
