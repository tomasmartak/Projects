Spheroid Analyser:
  - This opens as a Jupyter Notebook. Currently, this does not fully function as a standalone script yet - there are still some minor issues to iron out.
  - To use the script, manually input the path to a directory containing spheroid images (.jpg format only for now) into cell 2. Run cell 1 only once, the run cell 2 as many times as needed with various paths.
